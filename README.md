📈 Sales Prediction App
🚀 Overview
This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts sales based on advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The app uses a pre-trained Machine Learning model to provide predictions based on user inputs.

🛠 Features
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Built with Streamlit for an intuitive experience.
✅ Machine Learning-Powered – Uses a pre-trained model (classifier.pkl) for predictions.
✅ Real-Time Input – Accepts budget values for TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising.
✅ Error Handling – Handles missing model files and incorrect input gracefully.
✅ Mobile-Friendly UI – Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

❗ Troubleshooting
🔴 Error: "classifier.pkl not found"
Ensure classifier.pkl is in the same directory as app.py.

If missing, re-train and save your ML model using Scikit-learn:

python
Copy
Edit
